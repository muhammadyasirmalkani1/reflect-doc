              Reflect's AI assistant isn't just another chatbotâ€”it's a thinking partner that understands your entire
              knowledge base and helps you make connections you might never have discovered on your own.

            <h2>Getting Started with AI Assistance</h2>
            <p>
              The AI assistant in Reflect is always available through the command palette (Cmd+K) or by typing "/" in
              any note. But knowing when and how to use it effectively is what separates casual users from power users.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Intelligent Summarization</h2>
            <p>
              One of the most powerful features is the ability to summarize long notes or multiple related notes. Simply
              select the text you want summarized and ask the AI to create a concise overview.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-gray-900/50 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg p-4 my-6">
              <p className="text-gray-300 font-mono text-sm">
                <span className="text-purple-400">You:</span> "Summarize my notes about productivity techniques"
                <br />
                <span className="text-green-400">AI:</span> "Based on your 12 notes about productivity, here are the key
                themes: time-blocking (mentioned 8 times), the Pomodoro Technique (high success rate in your
                experiments), and morning routines (you noted 40% improvement in focus)..."
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2>2. Connection Discovery</h2>
            <p>
              The AI excels at finding unexpected connections between your notes. It can identify patterns, themes, and
              relationships that might not be immediately obvious.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Question-Driven Exploration</h2>
            <p>Instead of browsing through notes, try asking the AI specific questions about your knowledge base:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>"What are the common themes in my project retrospectives?"</li>
              <li>"How do my reading notes relate to my current work projects?"</li>
              <li>"What patterns do you see in my daily journal entries?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Creative Brainstorming</h2>
            <p>
              Use the AI as a brainstorming partner. It can generate ideas based on your existing notes and help you
              explore new directions.
            </p>

            <div className="bg-purple-900/20 border border-purple-500/30 rounded-lg p-4 my-6">
              <p className="text-purple-300 mb-2">
                <strong>Advanced Tip:</strong>
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-300">
                Ask the AI to "think like" different personas: "How would a designer approach this problem based on my
                notes?" or "What would a data scientist suggest here?"
              </p>
            </div>

            <h2>5. Research Assistance</h2>
            <p>
              When working on research projects, the AI can help you identify gaps in your knowledge, suggest areas for
              further exploration, and even help formulate research questions.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Writing and Communication</h2>
            <p>
              The AI can help you draft emails, create outlines, or even write first drafts based on your notes. It
              understands your writing style and can maintain consistency across documents.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Learning and Skill Development</h2>
            <p>
              Use the AI to create learning plans, generate quiz questions from your notes, or explain complex concepts
              in simpler terms.
            </p>

            <h2>Best Practices for AI Interaction</h2>
            <h3>Be Specific</h3>
            <p>
              The more specific your requests, the better the AI can help. Instead of "help me with my project," try
              "based on my project notes, what are the three biggest risks I should address first?"
            </p>

            <h3>Iterate and Refine</h3>
            <p>
              Don't expect perfect results on the first try. Use follow-up questions to refine the AI's responses and
              get exactly what you need.
            </p>

            <h3>Combine AI with Human Insight</h3>
            <p>
              The AI is a powerful tool, but it's most effective when combined with your own critical thinking and
              domain expertise.
            </p>

            <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>
            <p>
              Your notes and conversations with the AI are private and encrypted. The AI processes your data to provide
              personalized assistance but doesn't store or share your information.
            </p>

            <h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>
            <h3>Prompt Engineering</h3>
            <p>
              Learn to craft effective prompts by being clear about context, desired output format, and specific
              requirements.
            </p>

            <h3>Workflow Integration</h3>
            <p>
              Integrate AI assistance into your regular workflows. For example, end each week by asking the AI to
              analyze your progress and suggest improvements.
            </p>

            <h2>The Future of AI-Assisted Thinking</h2>
            <p>
              As you use Reflect's AI assistant more, it becomes better at understanding your thinking patterns and
              preferences. This creates a personalized thinking partner that grows more valuable over time.
            </p>

            <p>
              The goal isn't to replace your thinkingâ€”it's to augment it. The AI helps you see patterns you might miss,
              explore ideas you might not consider, and make connections that lead to breakthrough insights.
            </p>
