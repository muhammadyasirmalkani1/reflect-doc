**What are Backlinks?**
Backlinks are automatic two-way connections between notes. When you link to a note using [[Note Name]], both notes become connected.

**Creating Links:**
‚Ä¢ Type [[Note Name]] to link to any note
‚Ä¢ If the note doesn't exist, it will be created automatically
‚Ä¢ Links appear as clickable blue text

**Viewing Connections:**
‚Ä¢ See all backlinks in the right sidebar
‚Ä¢ Use the graph view to visualize your knowledge network
‚Ä¢ Find related notes through the "Connected Notes" section

**Best Practices:**
‚Ä¢ Link liberally - don't overthink it
‚Ä¢ Use consistent naming for topics
‚Ä¢ Review the graph view regularly to discover patterns
‚Ä¢ Create hub notes for major topics

**Advanced Tips:**
‚Ä¢ Use block references with [[Note Name#Block]] for specific sections
‚Ä¢ Combine with tags for powerful organization
‚Ä¢ Let the AI suggest relevant connections

Backlinks transform isolated notes into a powerful, interconnected knowledge system.`,
